    Github: `You've found my <a href = "https://github.com/PurpleAsterDuchess" target = "_blank"> code repository</a>. My programming journey began in primary school when we learnt scratch. It taught me the basics of the skills such as logical thinking needed in programming. I then went on to learn a few other languages and made my first commit to GitHub in 2023. I didn't really know how to use it then, but with practice, I am now able to work on projects with others. I learnt how to use many other collaboration tools such as Jira and Trello and have worked on quite a few projects.`,
    Languages: `So far, I know the following programming languages:
    <ul>
    <li>Python, the first language I ever learnt</li>

    <ul>
    <li>Maths: A</li>
    <li>Chemisty: B</li>
    <li>Biology: B</li>
    </ul>

    I had a few other things I was working towards during my studies... you can walk around a bit and find out more about what they were`,
