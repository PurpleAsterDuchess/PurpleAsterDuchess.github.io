    Github: `You've found my <a href = "https://github.com/PurpleAsterDuchess" target = "_blank"> code repository</a>. My programming journey began in primary school when we learnt scratch. It taught me the basics of the skills such as logical thinking needed in programming. I then went on to learn a few other languages and made my first commit to GitHub in 2023. I didn't really know how to use it then, but with practice, I am now able to work on projects with others. I learnt how to use many other collaboration tools such as Jira and Trello and have worked on quite a few projects.`,
    Languages: `So far, I know the following programming languages:
    <ul>
    <li>Python, the first language I ever learnt</li>

    <li>Typescript</li>
    <li>Rust, a language I learnt during my time at university</li>
    <li>HTML and CSS</li>
    <li>C++, a language I taught myself</li>

    <ul>
    <li>Computer Science: 9</li>
    <li>Mathematics: 9</li>

    <ul>
    <li>Maths: A</li>
    <li>Chemisty: B</li>
    <li>Biology: B</li>
    </ul>

    I had a few other things I was working towards during my studies... you can walk around a bit and find out more about what they were`,
    CV: ` You can learn about me in more detail here but if you're short on time, you could download my <a href="PrinaParekhCV.pdf.crdownload" download>CV</a>.`,
    "Code snippets": `I've done some bits of code for projects as well. I'm still compiling these but you could always come back later and have a look :)`,
    Volunteering: `I've done quite a bit of volunteering. I enjoy helping people and inspiring them. I've done some volunteering in a Covid vaccination center. It was very rewarding and it meant I could talk to a variety of people and I was able to comfort them through the uncertainty of getting vaccinated. I also did volunteering in a charity that aimed to raise money for children that could not afford an education. I had to organise events and raise money with a team. It taught me a lot about time management as well as working with and managing a team along with many other skills. I am also a STEM ambassador. I enjoy learning new things and I hope to inspire others to feel the same.`,
    DofE: `I've done DofE and gotten a certificate [cert]....`,
    Piano: `I have gotten to grade 6 for Piano with an Merit. Piano is my favorite instrument. I started playing around 6. This wasn't always the case, but with time I grew to love it. I continued playing through both GCSEs and A-Levels, which is when I got my grade 6 certification.`,
    Guitar: `I began with playing the acoustic guitar and bought an electric guitar a few years into my journey. I prefer playing electric because most technical songs are on electric, though there are quite a few good songs on acoustic that are fun to play.`,
    Flute: `I started playing flute around 9 years old. It used to be my favorite instrument but I couldn't find many songs I wanted to learn on it after a while. I still enjoy playing it and would love to find more songs to spark my inspiration once again.`,
    Singing: `I love singing! The voice is such a portable instrument and it's so versitile. `,
